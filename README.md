# Triangle Challenge
A tiny project that takes the lengths of a triangle's sides and returns, which kind of triangle it is.

## How do I launch the project?
1. Run `npm install` in the project's directory
2. When that is finished, just run gulp by typing `gulp` and that will start the server.
3. Test the solution
